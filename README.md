Autonomous PiCar: PID Control & Computer Vision Integration
Project Overview
Developed a fully autonomous robotic platform using a Raspberry Pi and Python. This project demonstrates the integration of high-frequency sensor data, real-time control theory, and computer vision for autonomous navigation.

Key Technical Achievements
High-Frequency PID Control: Engineered a PID controller with a sampling rate of 200 Hz to regulate DC motor rotational speed.

System Precision: Optimized control parameters to achieve a steady-state error of only 0.016%.

Computer Vision Navigation: Developed an autonomous tracking algorithm using HSV color space and image moments to detect targets and execute a precise "docking" sequence.

Real-time Multithreading: Leveraged Python threading to enable concurrent manual overrides and autonomous data logging.
