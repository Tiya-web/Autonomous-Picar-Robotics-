# Autonomous-Picar-Robotics-
Autonomous Raspberry Pi robotics platform featuring PID control and computer vision.

Project Overview
Developed a fully autonomous robotic platform using a Raspberry Pi and Python. The system integrates high-frequency sensor data collection, PID control for motor regulation, and computer vision for environmental navigation.   

Key Technical Achievements
High-Frequency PID Control: Implemented a PID controller with a sampling rate of 200 Hz (0.0050s intervals).   

Precision Performance: Optimized system parameters to achieve a steady-state error of only 0.016%.   

Computer Vision Navigation: Engineered an autonomous tracking algorithm using HSV color space and image moments to detect targets and execute a precise "docking" sequence.   

Real-time Multithreading: Leveraged Python threading to enable concurrent manual overrides and autonomous data logging
